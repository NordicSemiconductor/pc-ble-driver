## Overview

`pc-ble-driver` consists of a set of static and shared libraries that provide [SoftDevice](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.s140.api.v6.1.1/modules.html) functionality to the application via serial port communication with an nRF5 connectivity chip running the SoftDevice and connectivity software, included as a single .hex file [here](./hex/). For more information on SoftDevice serialization see [Serialization](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.3.0/lib_serialization.html).

The C/C++ libraries can be interfaced with directly, but are also provided as higher-level bindings that ease development at the cost of reduced control (acceptable in most cases):

* [pc-ble-driver-js Node.JS bindings](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-ble-driver-js)
* [pc-ble-driver-py Python bindings](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-ble-driver-py)

## Architecture

![Architecture](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.3.0/architecture_overview_serialization.svg)

Where the 'Application chip' is just generic hardware (i.e. a Windows, Linux or macOS device), although it could also be an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for example.

---

## Supported environments

#### Operating system

* Windows 7, 8 and 10, 32 and 64-bit (tested on Windows 7)
* Ubuntu Linux LTS 64-bit (tested on Ubuntu 18.04)
* macOS 64-bit (tested on 10.14 Mojave)

#### SoftDevice and IC

To use pc-ble-driver, your Development Kit needs to have the correct firmware. The needed firmwares are found in the `hex/sd_api_v<x>` folder and contain the SoftDevice and connectivity firmware required to communicate with `pc-ble-driver`.

The generated libraries are compatible with the following SoftDevice API versions and nRF5x ICs:

* SoftDevice s130 API version 2: `connectivity_<version>_1m_with_s130_2.x.x` (nRF51 and nRF52 series ICs)
* SoftDevice s132 API version 3: `connectivity_<version>_<1m|*usb>_with_s132_3.x.x` (only for nRF52 series ICs)
* SoftDevice s132 API version 5: `connectivity_<version>_<1m|*usb>_with_s132_5.x.x` (only for nRF52 series ICs)
* SoftDevice s132 API version 6: `connectivity_<version>_<1m|*usb>_with_s132_6.x.x` (only for nRF52 series ICs)
* SoftDevice s140 API version 6: `connectivity_<version>_<1m|*usb>_with_s140_6.x.x` (only for nRF52 series ICs)

*usb) only for nRF52 series ICs with USBD peripheral

###### Supported Development Kits
| PCA      | Official name                | Article number | Notes    |
-----------|------------------------------|----------------|----------|
| PCA10028 | nRF51 DEVELOPMENT KIT        | nRF6824        |          |
| PCA10031 | nRF51 DONGLE                 | nRF6825        |          |
| PCA10040 | nRF52 DEVELOPMENT KIT        | nRF6827        |          |
| PCA10056 | nRF52840 { Development Kit } | nRF6828        | *)       |
| PCA10059 | nRF52840 { Dongle }          | nRF6829        | Can only use connectivity firmware with Nordic USB CDC serial port support  |

*) Can use both Nordic USB CDC serial port version and SEGGER J-Link-OB (VCOM) version. Using Nordic USB CDC serial port version on PCA10056 requires that you connect pins P0.18 and P0.24. The pins to QSPI chip must also be in place (they are by default). The algorithm for detecting if it is PCA10056 or PCA10059 is to check if it is possible to communicate with the QSPI chip. PCA10059 does not have a QSPI chip. The detection is used by nRF Connect DFU trigger to determine what pin to use for resetting the device when changing between DFU and application mode.

## Installing device drivers

### Driver installation

This communication library works over any kind of serial port (UART), but it is most often used over a Segger J-Link USB CDC UART.
To set up the required J-Link drivers simply download and install the version matching you operating system:

* [SEGGER J-Link](https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html)

After you have installed the required drivers and connected a J-Link enabled board (such as the Nordic Development Kits) the port should be available.

In addition, you have to disable the `Mass Storage Device` in order to use `pc-ble-driver` to communicate with the device, [see `data corruption or drops issue`](./Issues.md#Data-corruption-or-drops).

### Driver validation

#### Validating on Windows

The serial port will appear as `COMxx`.
Simply check the "Ports (COM & LPT)" section in the Device Manager.

#### Validating on Ubuntu Linux

The serial port will appear as `/dev/ttyACMx`.

By default the port is not accessible to all users. Type the command below to add your user to the `dialout` group to give it access to the serial port. Note that re-login is required for this to take effect.

```bash
    $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>
```

To prevent the modemmanager service from trying to connect to the CDC ACM serial port:

```bash
    $ systemctl stop ModemManager.service
    $ systemctl disable ModemManager.service
```

#### Validating on macOS

The serial port will appear as `/dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX`.


There is a known issue, check it [here](./issues/Issues.md#Timeout-error-related-to-the-SEGGER-J-Link-firmware)
if you met any problems.

## Installing tools

#### nRF5x Command-Line Tools

To program the connectivity firmware you will need `nrfjprog` which is bundled with the nRF5x Command-Line Tools, which can be downloaded from:

* [nRF5x Command-Line Tools for Windows](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF51822/nRF5x-Command-Line-Tools-Win32/33444)
* [nRF5x Command-Line Tools for Linux 32-bit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF51822/nRF5x-Command-Line-Tools-Linux32/52615)
* [nRF5x Command-Line Tools for Linux 64-bit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF51822/nRF5x-Command-Line-Tools-Linux64/51386)
* [nRF5x Command-Line Tools for macOS](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF51822/nRF5x-Command-Line-Tools-OSX/53402)

Add `nrfjprog` and `mergehex` to `PATH` on Linux and macOS.

#### nRF Connect Programmer (optional)

Alternatively, `nRF Connect Programmer` can help you to program the connectivty firmware with UI support.

Download
[nRF Connect Desktop]( https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop)
and install `nRF Connect Programmer` there.

## Programming connectivity HEX files

### SEGGER J-Link-OB based kits
[Go to install tools](#Installing-tools) if the nRF5x Command-Line Tools have not been installed yet.

To use this library you will need to program the connectivity firmware on a nRF5x IC

Use [nRF5x Command-Line Tools](#Installing-tools) to erase and program the IC:

    $ nrfjprog -f NRF5<x> -e
    $ nrfjprog -f NRF5<x> --program hex/sd_api_v<x>/connectivity_<ver>_<baudrate>_with_s<x>_<a>.<b>.<c>.hex

Alternatively, use [nRF Connect Programmer](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-programmer)
to erase and program the IC.

### Nordic USB based kits

#### Installing drivers and tools
Some kits, like the pca10059 nRF52 dongle, do not have onboard debugger and will have to be programmed via serial DFU.
On Windows, device drivers are required for the kits to be detected correctly by the operating system. To install the required drivers, please make sure you have the latest [nRF Connect for Desktop](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF-Connect-for-desktop) installed.

#### Programming the connectivity firmware via serial DFU

Programming the connectivity firmware via serial DFU can be done from command line or from nRF Connect for Desktop.

##### Programming from command line with nrfutil

Device Firmware Upgrade with [nrfutil](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_nrfutil/UG/nrfutil/nrfutil_dfu_serial_usb.html) is normally done in two steps: 1: generating the DFU zip package, and 2: performing the DFU procedure. A DFU zip package has been pre-made and is included in this repository. To run the DFU procedure with nrfutil with the pre-made DFU package:

    nrfutil dfu usb-serial -pkg connectivity_x.x.x_usb_with_s<x>_<a>.<b>.<c>_dfu_pkg.zip -p <serial port>
